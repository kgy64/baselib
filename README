Basic Library
-------------

This library contains classes for handling files, threads, exceptions, and so on.

Portability:

It is easily portable, and currently has Unix and Android ports. Win32 port
is theoretically possible, but not implemented yet.
The porting is done in object-oriented mode, having different header file set
and source directory tree for each platform. In my code it is not allowed to
use #ifdef's for such purpose. This library is intended to do everything about
porting, the projects will be platform-independent this way.

Directory structure:

It is created to be compatible with my build system (see https://github.com/kgy64/makesys
for details). This library is added automatically by creating a new project with
that build system.
